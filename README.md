# Week4HW
I did not complete this assignment, yet I worked extremely hard on it for over a week. Javascript is definitely a learning curve. 
This code is supposed to:
Start a quiz with the start button
When started, the timer starts and questions and answer choices are displayed
A wrong answer subtracts 10 seconds from the score
Once the timer runs out or the user answers all of the questions, then they are prompted with an input to enter their initials
Once entered, the user is directed to a highscores page where they can see their best scores
